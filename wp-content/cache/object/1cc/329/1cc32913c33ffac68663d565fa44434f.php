This value serves to standardize taxes and that these are updated annually without the need to change their value in pesos, maintaining their equivalence in UVT. That is why the question of all Colombian taxpayers is: what is the value of UVT 2021?
<h2>What is the value of UVT 2021?</h2>
The value of the UVT (Tax Value Unit) is important at the time of the company's tax planning, for the accounting and fiscal closing of the company. In addition to having an effect on various responsibilities within an organization, it is therefore important to know the value of UVT 2021.&nbsp;In this sense, the government and the DIAN are in charge of announcing the value of the UVT in 2021, and each year this announcement usually occurs between November and December. This year it has already been announced what the value of the UVT will be for 2021, which will be applied from January 1.&nbsp;The VUT 2021 will have a value of $ 36,308, as announced in the draft resolution issued by DIAN. The value of the UVT 2021 increases by $ 701 in relation to the value of 2020, an amount that is linked to the increase in the CPI in the period October 1, 2019 and October 1, 2020. The new value of the UVT will apply for the collection of taxes, charges, fines, penalties, fees, stamps, budgets, salaries and state costs.&nbsp;
<h2>Official Value of UVT 2020</h2>
The UVT for the taxable year 2020 reflects a value of $ 35,607 according to resolution DIAN 000084 of November 28, 2019. So those who declare income in 2021 must apply this value to the calculation of the limits from which to determine which persons Naturals must make a statement.&nbsp;
<h2>How is UVT 2021 applied?</h2>
Knowing what the value of UVT 2021 is, you can calculate how much you will have to pay in the respective taxes in which this unit is applied. It is enough to take the value of the current UVT and multiply it by the value set for the respective tax. The result of this account is approximated in accordance with the procedure established in the Tax State.&nbsp;In this way, if a tax is 100 UVT, for example, simply take the value of UVT 2021, $ 36,308, and multiply it by 100. The result of this operation ($ 3,630,800) will be the value of the tax in question .&nbsp;It is also important to mention that tax penalties, except for the exceptions established by law, are also applied in UVT, the minimum penalty being 10 UVT, that is, $ 363,800.&nbsp;The idea of ​​establishing the UVT is that the variation with respect to the taxes and sanctions applied by the DIAN have a single change applicable to all tax obligations. It is easier to establish a reference unit that applies to all taxes than to change the value of each one each year.&nbsp;<strong>Tax Value - UVT 2008-2021</strong>2021: $36.308 (Official Value)2020: $35.6072019: $34.2702018: $33.1562017: $31.8592016: $29.7532015: $28.2792014: $27.4852013: $26.8412012: $26.0492011: $25.1322010: $24.5552009: $23.7632008: $22.054&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind what is the value of the UVT 2021, $ 36,308, each taxpayer will be able to calculate how much they must pay in the taxes established with this unit. With this unit, the payment of taxes is updated according to the country's inflation rates and does not lose value for the State, in addition to facilitating the treatment of taxes for both taxpayers and the DIAN.";s:10:"post_title";s:20:"¿Value of UVT 2021?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:31:"cual-es-el-valor-de-la-uvt-2021";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2021-02-19 05:50:16";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2021-02-19 05:50:16";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:33:"https://www.machinsoft.com/?p=285";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
