At the same time, these providers are adopting Agile development methodologies to better scale up and meet growing enterprise demand.</p><p>“Enterprises that see the digital future are moving away from legacy approaches to software development and maintenance,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “Rapidly changing customer demands require more agility as well as greater efficiency, and service providers are stepping up with powerful new capabilities.”</p><p>Faced with the COVID-19 crisis, ADM service providers quickly regrouped with measures to ensure business continuity, security and efficiency, the report says. By increasing their use of collaboration tools, they achieved the scale and productivity they needed, and in some cases stepped up to remotely serve clients in supply chain and logistics.</p><h3>Increasing use of analytics, AI and ML</h3><p>Continuous application testing methods also advanced in 2020 with increasing use of analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The large and growing volume of available test data makes visibility and insights more important, a trend that is also increasing demand for better visualization tools.</p><p>With the many testing tools on offer, flexibility and integration with ADM services is critical, and service providers are forming new partnerships with continuous testing specialists.</p><p>In DevOps implementations, which have been widely adopted to speed up application development and improve enterprise agility, security is now taking center stage, according to the report. Most service providers have integrated this element into the DevOps lifecycle, embracing a DevSecOps approach.</p></div>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p>.NET Core placed high in a web-dominated ranking of development frameworks published by CodinGame, which provides a tech hiring platform.</p><p>The survey asked about frameworks in terms of popularity (frameworks that are known) and those that are in demand by employers. Microsoft&#8217;s .NET Core ranked third in the known category, behind Node.js and React. The list shows strong placements by JavaScript/web technologies, including Vue.js, Angular variants, Django and more.</p><p>&#8220;Node.js, React and .NET Core are currently the most popular frameworks amongst developers,&#8221; CodinGame said. &#8220;React is the most sought-after framework: 59 percent of tech recruiters are on the lookout for developers who know React. Unfortunately, only 27.6 percent of programmers say that they know how to use the open-source JavaScript library.</p><p>&#8220;Another framework that makes recruiters&#8217; top three is Angular2+. Indeed, 41 percent of recruiters are on the lookout for Angular2+ specialists. Alas, only 16.9 percent of developers say that they know the application framework.&#8221;</p><p>The survey polled nearly 15,000 developers and HR pros from around the world and was conducted at the end of 2020 (from October to December 2020). Of course, right in the middle of that time, .NET Core became <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/11/10/net-5-ga.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.NET 5</a>. Nevertheless, it speaks to how much traction the .NET ecosystem has gained even before the general availability of .NET 5, especially considering the large influence of JavaScript/web tech in the survey.</p><p>Though the survey was light on .NET tech, Microsoft&#8217;s C# programming language did rank fourth in the list of &#8220;in-demand languages&#8221; and was No. 6 in the &#8220;known&#8221; category.</p><div><p>JavaScript, Java and Python are (consistently) the most well-known programming languages out there. More than half of developers know how to code in these 3 languages,&#8221; CodinGame said. &#8220;Companies are in sync with developers when it comes to major programming languages JavaScript and Java: close to 60 percent have high demand for these languages.</p><p>&#8220;However, when it comes to other languages such as Python, C or C++, there&#8217;s a spanner [wrench] in the works. For example: 45.1 percent of developers code in C, but only 15.4 percent of companies need C development.&#8221;</p><p>As might be inferred from the use of the word &#8220;spanner,&#8221; CodinGame is headquartered in Europe (France), with a presence in the U.S. And, as might be expected from a hiring platform specialist, the survey was heavy on recruitment questions. Here are some highlights of the survey:</p><ul><li>When developers were asked what position they held, the largest percentage of respondents reported full-stack (24 percent), followed by software developer (20 percent) and back-end, (15 percent).</li><li>80 percent of HR professionals recruit developers with non-academic backgrounds.</li><li>48 percent of companies offer developers the possibility to work 100 percent remotely.</li><li>DevOps are the most in-demand developers for 2021.</li><li>Candidate experience is what the majority of tech professionals will focus on in 2021.</li><li>The majority of companies (64 percent) are looking to hire up to 50 developers this year.</li><li>When HR pros were asked which which positions they have demand for, but predict they&#8217;ll struggle to recruit in 2021, the top three were DevOps, back-end developers and full-stack developers.</li><li>The best-paid developers work in the Security industry ($55,598), followed by Technology, Insurance and Energy.</li><li>Software architects are (for the second year in a row) the world&#8217;s best-paid developers, followed by Data scientists. Both of these high-flying positions boast average annual wages of above $55,000.</li><li>Related to the question directly above, wages for other positions, such as Front-end developer or Tester, are considerably lower. Indeed, Front-end developers across the world are paid $34,946 on average.</li><li>When asked if they preferred to work remotely or at the office, only 5 percent of coders said that they&#8217;d choose to work 100 percent at the office.</li><li>The vast majority of developers would prefer some sort of office/remote organization. The winning set up is &#8220;a few remote days per week&#8221; (43.2 percent).</li><li>The majority of programmers (58.8 percent) learn to code either at university or at school. However, close to 35 percent consider themselves to be self-taught.</li><li>Developers are still looking for the same things in job opportunities: technical challenges, flexible working hours and a competitive salary.</li><li>HR pros said their biggest challenges are finding qualified candidates, standing out from other companies to attract talent, aligning with hiring managers&#8217; demands/job requirements, and recruiting within tight time-frames.</li><li>Both developers and HR pros preferred face-to-face, traditional interviews, although HR pros were much more likely to prefer videoconferencing interviews than developers were.</li></ul><p>&#8220;In 2020, there&#8217;s been some major market shifts, with the generalization of remote work and the rise of non-academic developer profiles, for example. However, some things remain the same: programmers are still on the lookout for technical challenges and flexible working hours, LinkedIn is still a hotbed of tech hiring and recruiters still struggle to find qualified candidates,&#8221; the company said in conclusion.</p></div></div>

					<div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix"><p>The Tax Value Unit (UVT) is a referential unit that represents a value in pesos, which is updated annually by the DIAN according to the inflation of the year. This value serves to standardize taxes and that these are updated annually without the need to change their value in pesos, maintaining their equivalence in UVT. That is why the question of all Colombian taxpayers is: what is the value of UVT 2021?</p><h2>What is the value of UVT 2021?</h2><div>The value of the UVT (Tax Value Unit) is important at the time of the company&#8217;s tax planning, for the accounting and fiscal closing of the company. In addition to having an effect on various responsibilities within an organization, it is therefore important to know the value of UVT 2021.</div><div> </div><div>In this sense, the government and the DIAN are in charge of announcing the value of the UVT in 2021, and each year this announcement usually occurs between November and December. This year it has already been announced what the value of the UVT will be for 2021, which will be applied from January 1.</div><div> </div><div>The VUT 2021 will have a value of $ 36,308, as announced in the draft resolution issued by DIAN. The value of the UVT 2021 increases by $ 701 in relation to the value of 2020, an amount that is linked to the increase in the CPI in the period October 1, 2019 and October 1, 2020. The new value of the UVT will apply for the collection of taxes, charges, fines, penalties, fees, stamps, budgets, salaries and state costs.</div><div> </div><h2>Official Value of UVT 2020</h2><div>The UVT for the taxable year 2020 reflects a value of $ 35,607 according to resolution DIAN 000084 of November 28, 2019. So those who declare income in 2021 must apply this value to the calculation of the limits from which to determine which persons Naturals must make a statement.</div><div> </div><h2>How is UVT 2021 applied?</h2><div>Knowing what the value of UVT 2021 is, you can calculate how much you will have to pay in the respective taxes in which this unit is applied. It is enough to take the value of the current UVT and multiply it by the value set for the respective tax. The result of this account is approximated in accordance with the procedure established in the Tax State.</div><div> </div><div>In this way, if a tax is 100 UVT, for example, simply take the value of UVT 2021, $ 36,308, and multiply it by 100. The result of this operation ($ 3,630,800) will be the value of the tax in question .</div><div> </div><div>It is also important to mention that tax penalties, except for the exceptions established by law, are also applied in UVT, the minimum penalty being 10 UVT, that is, $ 363,800.</div><div> </div><div>The idea of ​​establishing the UVT is that the variation with respect to the taxes and sanctions applied by the DIAN have a single change applicable to all tax obligations. It is easier to establish a reference unit that applies to all taxes than to change the value of each one each year.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Tax Value &#8211; UVT 2008-2021</strong></div><div>2021: $36.308 (Official Value)</div><div>2020: $35.607</div><div>2019: $34.270</div><div>2018: $33.156</div><div>2017: $31.859</div><div>2016: $29.753</div><div>2015: $28.279</div><div>2014: $27.485</div><div>2013: $26.841</div><div>2012: $26.049</div><div>2011: $25.132</div><div>2010: $24.555</div><div>2009: $23.763</div><div>2008: $22.054</div><div>  </div><div><span class="JLqJ4b ChMk0b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="es" data-phrase-index="0">Bearing in mind what is the value of the UVT 2021, $ 36,308, each taxpayer will be able to calculate how much they must pay in the taxes established with this unit.</span> <span class="JLqJ4b ChMk0b" data-language-for-alternatives="en" data-language-to-translate-into="es" data-phrase-index="1">With this unit, the payment of taxes is updated according to the country&#8217;s inflation rates and does not lose value for the State, in addition to facilitating the treatment of taxes for both taxpayers and the DIAN.</span></div></div>
